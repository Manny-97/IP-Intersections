## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

An algorithm that process a given set of ip ranges by removing their intersections and returning a set of mutually exclusive ip ranges.
Technology 
● Python & Docker 


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Create a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
No extra requirements for now
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

To run the algorithm, copy and execute the command on the terminal

```
python manage.py examples/input.txt
```


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
